	<p>Being motivated is about finding what makes you excited about running. It could be feeling strong, or being able to do 
		something (like a 5k)! It could be social, like joining a group that makes you excited about running- there are 
		community and school groups for running with other passionate runners where all you have to do is show up with your 
		shoes. It could be wanting a break from work, or something consistent to look forward to- and trust me, running can 
		do this for you.

	<p>This is me! What made me excited about running is seeing an Ironman race for the first time. I watched as hundreds of
		men and women crossed the finish line at the marathon, completely in awe of their strength. This lit my spark. 
		I was led to find rolemodels like Lucy Charles-Barclay and Shalane Flanagan, an Ironman Champion and 
		Olympic Champion-turned legendary marathon running mom, respectively. 
		Since my first running spark was lit, when I meet people who run, I'm fascinated in their journey.
